# FoodvisorLM üçé
A webapp to find potentially harmful ingredients in packaged food and find similar products built using AWS OpenSearch, SageMaker, DynamoDB, Cognito, Docker, Flask, and OpenAI API.

### Background
While I find [Yuka](https://yuka.io/en/) very useful for this, I started this project with two questions:
1) How can the recent advances in NLP help summarize research in health and food science per ingredient?
2) Since the ratings by a human expert may induce bias, is a qualitative stance better than Yuka's rating system?

### Design Choices
#### Web hosting
| AWS Service | Pros and Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Lambda | Scalable but cold-starts are slow |
| S3 | Scalable but static pages only |
| Amplify | Scalable and JavaScript-based whereas this app uses Flask for lightweight API |
| Lightsail | Load balancing, isolated, free tier but no blue/green deployments and auto scaling |
| Elastic Beanstalk | Robust solution but insufficient free tier EC2 credits |

#### Database
Product barcode data is largely structured and contains millions of rows, hence RDS or DynamoDB are well-suited. However, for User History, DynamoDB is better suited due to scalability.

### Future Ideas
- [ ] Deploy custom retrieval-augmented generation pipeline for label classification
- [ ] Cite relevant articles in RAG
- [ ] Recommend healthier alternatives as opposed to similar products only

This is a part of my project for Cloud Computing and Big Data at New York University, Fall 2023 taught by Prof. Sambit Sahu.
